List of problems:
1.1.1. One can reach city Q from city P by sea, air and road. Suppose that there are 2 ways by sea, 3 ways by air and 2 ways by road. What are the total number of ways from P to Q by sea, air or road?
1.1.2. Find the number of ordered pairs (x,y) of integers such that x^2 + y^2 <= 5.
1.1.3. To reach city D from city A, one has to pass through city B and then C. If there are 2 ways to travel from A to B, 5 ways from B to C, and 3 ways from C to D. What are the total number of ways from A to D via B and C?
1.1.4. For a given k, n from N, how many different k-ary sequences of length n can we form? In other words, what is the size of the set containing all the k-ary sequences of length n?
1.1.5. Find the number of positive divisors of 600, inclusive of 1 to 600 itself.
1.1.6. Let X = {1,2,...,100} and let S = {(a,b,c) | a,b,c from X, a<b and a<c}. Find |S|. Solve the same problem when (a<b<c).
1.2.1. Let A = {a,b,c,d}. Find all the 3-permutations of A.
1.2.2. Let E = {a,b,c,...,x,y,z} be the set of the 26 English alphabets. Find the number of 5-letter words that can be formed from E such that the first and last letters are distinct vowels and the remaining three are distinct consonants.
1.2.3. There are 7 boys and 3 girls in a gathering.  In how many ways can they be arranged in a row so that (i) the 3 girls form a single block (i.e. there is no boy between any two of the girls)? (ii) the two end-positions are occupied by boys and no girls are adjacent?
1.2.4. Between 20000 and 70000, find the number of even integers in which no digit is repeated.
1.2.5. Let S be the set of natural numbers whose digits are chosen from {1,3,5,7} such that no digits are repeated. Find (i) |S| (ii) Summation(n) over all the set S.
