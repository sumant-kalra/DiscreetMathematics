* Examples: 
[1] Consider the experiment of picking a random card from a standard deck of 52 cards (with all cards equally likely), and the following four events:
    A: card is a heart;
    B: card is a diamond;
    C: card is an ace;
    D: card has a black suit.
    
    As a set, A consists of 13 cards: {Ace of Hearts, Two of Hearts, . . . , King of Hearts}.
    - What event is A ∩ C (describe in words)? What event is A ∪ B? 
    - What about (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)? 
    - If the 3 of Clubs is drawn, which of A, B, C, D occurred? 
    - How is A ∪ B related to Dc? If the card drawn were a Joker, what would you conclude about the sample space?

[2] A coin is flipped 10 times. Writing Heads as 1 and Tails as 0, the outcome is a sequence (s1, . . . , s10) with sj ∈ {0, 1}, 
    and the sample space S consists of the 2^10 = 1024 such sequences. Let Aj be the event that sj = 1. 
    How can the events “at least one flip was Heads”, “exactly one flip was Heads”, “all the flips were Heads”,
    and “there were two consecutive Heads” be written compactly in set notation?
